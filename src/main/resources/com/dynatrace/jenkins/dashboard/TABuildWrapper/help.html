    The below properties will be available as build variables in all the build steps during build.
    You can use them to register test run on your own (in your scripts).

    Also the properties set in global plugin configuration ("Dynatrace Application Monitoring" config section)
    will be available as build variables: <i>'dtServerUrl'</i>, <i>'dtUsername'</i> and <i>'dtPassword'</i>.

    NOTE:<br/>
    If you decide not to use the below properties in your scripts and to register test runs on your own,
    please fill at least the <i>"System profile"</i> field to have the post-build action
    working properly.
